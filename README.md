# Quarantine Bar

## Project Proposal

### Description
Virtual bar with music options and cocktail recipes for those of us still in quarantine to enjoy. This app will allow you to input a select number of cocktail ingredients that you have at your disposal and return to you a list of cocktails that contain those ingredients. Additionally, you will be able to select a genre of music for your occasion and jam out while you make drinks from home!

### User Story
*AS AN individual stuck in quarantine,
I WANT to be able to meet up with my friends and look for drinks we can all make from the comfort of our homes,
SO that we can keep our distance but still have the fun of a bar at home!
APIs to be used- CocktailDB, YouTube
Rough breakdown of tasks-
`HTML` file will contain input fields for liquor base and one mixer you have at your home.
`HTML` file will also contain input fields for music genre you wish to listen too.
For CSS we will be using Bulma for our framework
`JS file` will contain button functionality and `$.ajax` requests to our two API's.
