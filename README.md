# Quarantine Bar
https://billyjhicksjr.github.io/qaurantinebar/

### Description
For this project we've created a virtual bar that allows the user to either randomly select a cocktail recipe from Cocktail DB or to search for a specific cocktail recipe. While your enjoying your beverages, jam out to the provided playlist or play the drinking game we've provided on the page! 

### Technologies Used
* Bulma
* Cocktail DB API
* day.js
* giphy API
* JavaScript
* JQuery

### User Story
*AS AN individual stuck in quarantine,  
I WANT to be able to meet up with my friends and look for drinks we can all make from the comfort of our homes,  
SO that we can keep our distance but still have the fun of a bar at home!
